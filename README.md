My fourth enty to the LDjam with the topic *Unstable*
This is an attempt to make an unstable management game. Lets see how this will turn out.

## Keep the Pressure

Keep the pressure is a micro reaction / casual game made for the LudumDare49 - Unstable game jam. 

Press the buttons and switches to lower the pressure of the valve. Keep it stable for 2 minutes to win the game. 
But beware, everything besides the layout is randomized.
